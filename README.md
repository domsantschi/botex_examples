# botex: a walk-through

### Idea

Have you ever thought about how you can use LLMs like Chat GPT when
designing and testing your (online) experiments? Are you interested in
studying the ‘behavior’ of LLMs? Or do you want to assess how humans
change their behavior when they interact with AI?

If your answer to any of these questions is yes (or if you are just
curious): We, Victor Maas from the University of Amsterdam, and Fikir
Worku Edossa as well as Joachim Gassen from Humboldt-Universität zu
Berlin and the Open Science Data Center of TRR 266 Accounting for
Transparency, have recently released
[‘botex’](https://github.com/joachim-gassen/botex), a Python package
that makes it straight-forward to use Chat GPT and even local LLM models
as participants in oTree experiments.

This repository provides a short walk-through explaining how to use
botex together with [oTree](https://www.otree.org) and the [OpenAI
API](https://openai.com/api).

### Setup

In order to use botex you first need to install it. We recommend to use
a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other packages.

``` bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
# this will change to pip install botex
pip install -i https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple botex==0.1.6
```

As we will be running a local oTree server in this walk-through, we
install oTree as well. Also we will install some additional packages
that are used in the example code.

``` bash
pip install otree
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

BTW: At least for uns, installing otree causes a warning about a
dependency conflict for the MarkupSafe package. We did not yet recognize
any issues with this, but if you do, please let us know.

Finally, botex uses [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) and
[ChromeDriver](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/chromedriver/get-started)
to scrape oTree webpages. Instructions to install these components are
contained in the links above.

### Configuration

Copy the file `_secrets.env` to `secrets.env` and edit to your needs.
Assuming that you will be using the OpenAI API, all you need to provide
is your API key.

### Starting the oTree server

To start the oTree server, run the following command in the terminal:

``` bash
cd otree
otree devserver
```

Once the server has started, you can go to `http://localhost:8000` in
your browser to see the oTree frontend. It should look like this:

### Running a human/bot experiment

If you want, you can now try out the experiment (the split screen
variant is nice for this) by clicking on the the experiment caption.
After clicking on it, you will also see to single use links that you can
use to participate in the experiment. The P1 link will be leading to the
investor role, while P2 will be the role of the manager.

Time to face an experiment with an LLM participant. Pick the role that
you want to play. Copy the other link into the code snippet below,
which - like all other snippets - is also available in the `code` folder
of this repository and run the code. Finally, click on your link to see
the instructions of the experiment and to start your run.

``` python
from os import environ
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import botex 

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('secrets.env')

# The missing config (botex_db, openai_api_key) will be read from the environment
botex.run_single_bot(
    url = "http://localhost:8000/InitializeParticipant/wojqsysx"
)
```

While participating in the experiment, you should be able to observe the
log messages of the bot in the terminal. If anything goes wrong, these
log messages might help you to identify the issue.

After completing the experiment, you could download the resulting data
from oTree exactly like you would for a ‘normal’ experiment. But here,
we are interested in the bot data. To get this data, you can run the
following code snippet:

``` python
import botex
from tabulate import tabulate

# Adjust this to where you stored the botex data 
BOTEX_DB = 'data/external/botex_single_exp.sqlite3'
part = botex.read_participants_from_botex_db(
  botex_db = BOTEX_DB
)
disp_part = [
  [r[v] for v in ('session_name', 'participant_id', 'time_in','time_out')] 
  for r in part
]
print(tabulate(
  disp_part, 
  headers=["Session", "Participant ID", "Time in", "Time out"],
  tablefmt="github"
))
```

| Session | Participant ID | Time in                          | Time out                         |
|---------|----------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| unknown | unknown        | 2024-07-11T09:10:31.398267+00:00 | 2024-07-11T09:12:56.355099+00:00 |

Well, this is interesting but frankly not that exciting. Let’s take a
look at the rationale data. For each answer that the bot provides, it
also provides a rationale underlying its answer.

``` python
# Reading response data from botex database
responses = botex.read_responses_from_botex_db(
  botex_db = BOTEX_DB
)
print(tabulate(responses, headers="keys" , tablefmt="github"))
```

| session_id | participant_id | round | question_id             | answer                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | reason                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

Now, this is somewhat more interesting and clearly indicates that the
bot got the gist of the experiment and the short post-experimental
questionaire.

### Running a bot only session

If you want to run an oTree session using only LLM participants. You can
do this using the `init_otree_session()` function and then use
`run_bots_on_sesssion()` to run the bots. The code below runs a session
on 5 bot investor/manager pairs.

``` python
import logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

import botex 

from dotenv import load_dotenv
load_dotenv('secrets.env')

mftrust = botex.init_otree_session(config_name = "mftrust", npart = 10)

botex.run_bots_on_session(
  session_id = mftrust['session_id']
)
```

### Take a look at the experimental results by using the botex data

In a real setting, you would most likely now download the experiment’s
data from oTree and work from there. However, you can also use the
response data from the botex directly for some quick test. From our
paper we know that Chat-GPT 4o bots are very likely to invest 50 in the
first round of a standard framed trust game (See Figure 4 of the paper).
How does providing the manager a communication option change the first
round behavior of the investor?

``` python
BOTEX_DB = 'data/external/botex_session_exp.sqlite3'
responses = botex.read_responses_from_botex_db(
  botex_db = BOTEX_DB
)
sent_amount_first_round = [
    r['answer'] for r in responses 
      if r['question_id'] == "id_sent_amount" and r['round'] == 1
]
print(tabulate(
    {"Sent Amount": sent_amount_first_round}, 
    headers = "keys", tablefmt="github"
))

from scipy import stats

t_stat, p_value = stats.ttest_1samp(sent_amount_first_round, 50)

print(f"t statistic: {t_stat:.2f} (p-value: {p_value:.3f})")
```

| Sent Amount |
|-------------|
| 100         |
| 50          |
| 70          |
| 60          |
| 70          |

t statistic: 2.39 (p-value: 0.075)

It certainly points into a direction. Not bad for a n=5 study, right?

## Let me take a peak under the hood: the prompting level

If you want to understand how the sausage is being made, it is ueful to
analyze the prompt level. See below for the prompting sequence that
generated the bot responses in the human bot setting.

``` python
import json
import re

# Adjust this to where you stored the botex data 
BOTEX_DB = 'data/external/botex_single_exp.sqlite3'

# Reading response data from botex database
conv = botex.read_conversations_from_botex_db(
  botex_db = BOTEX_DB
)
ps = json.loads(conv[0]['conversation'])
prompt_sequence = [
  {"role": p["role"], "content": re.sub(r'[\s+]', ' ', p["content"])}for p in ps
]
print(tabulate(prompt_sequence, headers="keys", tablefmt="github"))
```

| role      | content

| user      | Hi there! In this conversation. I want you to participate in an online survey and/or experiment, potentially involving other human or artificial participants. I will provide you with a series of web page body text excerpts that will sequentially guide you through the experiment/survey. The texts will contain instructions on how the experiment/survey will be conducted. These instructions will be followed by additional pages that might contain additional instructions, comprehension checks, repeated information from prior pages and, most importantly, present you with questions and/or tasks which I want you to answer. All answers must be given as JSON code ONLY and I will provide you with detailed information on the respective format. As all texts are scraped from the body parts of web pages, they might contain also additional information or text bits that do not really belong to the experiment. Do you understand your task? Please answer by setting the value of ‘understood’ to ‘yes’ or ‘no’, meaning that {“understood”: “yes”} indicates that you understand. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.

| user      | Perfect. This is the body text of the entry page of the survey/experiment:This is an experiment on decision-making by managers and investors. You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant. The roles of manager and investors are randomly assigned to you and the other participant. You will learn your role prior to making any decision. During the experiment, you and the other participant can earn points. The amount of points that you earned will determine the likelihood that you will win an 100€ Amazon voucher that will be raffled out among what we plan to be about 100 participants in this experiment. After the role assignment, the manager has the option to send a free form text message to the investor. Only the manager can send a message and they can only send one message at the beginning of the experiment. This experiment lasts 3 rounds. Each round, the investor starts with an endowment of 100 points and the manager starts with an endowment of 0 points. The investor can invest none, some, or all of their endowment in the firm run by the manager. Each point that the investor invests in the firm run by the manager is multiplied by 3. The manager then needs to decide how much of this multiplied amount they send to the investor as a dividend. Anything that the manager does not send to the investor, they can keep for themselves. Example: Suppose that the investor chooses to invest 50 points. This amount is then multiplied by 3, such that the manager now has 150 points. Suppose the manager sends back 50 points to the investor. The payoff of the investor then is 100 points (100 - 50 50) and the payoff of the manager then is 100 points (0 150 - 50).

| assistant | { “summary”: “This is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points.” }

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:Choice You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor. This is the only option for you to send a message. If you do not want to send a message, you can leave the field blank. Please enter your message to the investor: Nextneed you to do two things. First, this page contains 1 question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable ‘questions’. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including the old summary given above, all questions, and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable ‘summary’. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables ‘questions’, and ‘summary’. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: ‘\[{“question_id”: “id_message”, “question_type”: “textarea”, “question_label”: “Please enter your message to the investor:”}\]’. Each question is characterized by an ID (‘question_id’), question type (‘question_type’), and a label (‘question_label’). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is ‘number’, please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: ‘id’ gives the question ID, ‘reason’ contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, ‘answer’ which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, ‘questions’ becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {“questions”: \[{“id”: “ID of first question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}, {“id”: “ID of second question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}\], “summary”: “Your summary”}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points.have now proceeded to the next page.

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have now proceeded to the next page. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor. This is the only option for you to send a message. If you do not want to send a message, you can leave the field blank. The question on the page is: 1. Please enter your message to the investor. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!”have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:Choice You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. This round, the investor invested 80 points. This amount was multiplied by 3 so you now have 240 points. How many points do you want to send as a dividend to the investor? Sent Back Amount points Nextneed you to do two things. First, this page contains 1 question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable ‘questions’. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including the old summary given above, all questions, and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable ‘summary’. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables ‘questions’, and ‘summary’. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: ‘\[{“question_id”: “id_sent_back_amount”, “question_type”: “number”, “question_label”: “Sent Back Amount”}\]’. Each question is characterized by an ID (‘question_id’), question type (‘question_type’), and a label (‘question_label’). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is ‘number’, please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: ‘id’ gives the question ID, ‘reason’ contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, ‘answer’ which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, ‘questions’ becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {“questions”: \[{“id”: “ID of first question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}, {“id”: “ID of second question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}\], “summary”: “Your summary”}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have now proceeded to the next page. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor. This is the only option for you to send a message. If you do not want to send a message, you can leave the field blank. The question on the page is: 1. Please enter your message to the investor. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” You have now proceeded to the next page. The investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. The current question on the page asks how many points the manager wants to send back as a dividend to the investor. The question is as follows: 1. Sent Back Amount: points You decided to send back 80 points to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:You are in round 1 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 80 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 240 points. You chose to return 80 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 240 points - 80 points = 160 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 160 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 100 points. Nextneed you to summarize the information from this page and to incorporate this summary into the summary provided above. Taken together, the new summary should summarize everything you know about the experiment. The summary needs to be stored in the variable ‘summary’.So, your JSON answer will contain only the variable ‘summary’. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string.

| assistant | { “summary”: “This is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points.have now proceeded to the next page.

The investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. The current question on the page asks how many points the manager wants to send back as a dividend to the investor. The question is as follows:. Sent Back Amount: pointsdecided to send back 80 points to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds.have now proceeded to the next page. You are in round 1 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 80 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 240 points. You chose to return 80 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 240 points - 80 points = 160 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 160 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 100 points.” }

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have now proceeded to the next page. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor. This is the only option for you to send a message. If you do not want to send a message, you can leave the field blank. The question on the page is: 1. Please enter your message to the investor. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” You have now proceeded to the next page. The investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. The current question on the page asks how many points the manager wants to send back as a dividend to the investor. The question is as follows: 1. Sent Back Amount: points You decided to send back 80 points to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. You have now proceeded to the next page. You are in round 1 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 80 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 240 points. You chose to return 80 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 240 points - 80 points = 160 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 160 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 100 points.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:Choice You are in round 2 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 60 points. This amount was multiplied by 3 so you now have 180 points. How many points do you want to send as a dividend to the investor? Sent Back Amount points Nextneed you to do two things. First, this page contains 1 question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable ‘questions’. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including the old summary given above, all questions, and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable ‘summary’. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables ‘questions’, and ‘summary’. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: ‘\[{“question_id”: “id_sent_back_amount”, “question_type”: “number”, “question_label”: “Sent Back Amount”}\]’. Each question is characterized by an ID (‘question_id’), question type (‘question_type’), and a label (‘question_label’). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is ‘number’, please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: ‘id’ gives the question ID, ‘reason’ contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, ‘answer’ which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, ‘questions’ becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {“questions”: \[{“id”: “ID of first question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}, {“id”: “ID of second question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}\], “summary”: “Your summary”}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. You are now on the page for round 2 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:You are in round 2 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You chose to return 60 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points.

The summary needs to be stored in the variable ‘summary’.So, your JSON answer will contain only the variable ‘summary’. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| assistant | { “summary”: “This is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: ‘Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!’ In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points.” }

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: ‘Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!’ In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:Choice You are in round 3 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 40 points. This amount was multiplied by 3 so you now have 120 points. How many points do you want to send as a dividend to the investor? Sent Back Amount points Nextneed you to do two things. First, this page contains 1 question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable ‘questions’. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including the old summary given above, all questions, and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable ‘summary’. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables ‘questions’, and ‘summary’. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: ‘\[{“question_id”: “id_sent_back_amount”, “question_type”: “number”, “question_label”: “Sent Back Amount”}\]’. Each question is characterized by an ID (‘question_id’), question type (‘question_type’), and a label (‘question_label’). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is ‘number’, please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: ‘id’ gives the question ID, ‘reason’ contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, ‘answer’ which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, ‘questions’ becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {“questions”: \[{“id”: “ID of first question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}, {“id”: “ID of second question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}\], “summary”: “Your summary”}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

Given the strategy of maintaining trust and ensuring cooperation, it is reasonable to send back 40 points.” }                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points. In round 3 of 3 rounds, the investor invested 40 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 120 points for the manager. The main question is how many points to send back to the investor as a dividend. Given the strategy of maintaining trust and ensuring cooperation, it is reasonable to send back 40 points.have now proceeded to the next page. This is the body text of the web page:You are in round 3 of 3 rounds. This round, the investor invested 40 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 120 points. You chose to return 40 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 120 points - 40 points = 80 points. This was the last round. The total number of points you earned in the 3 rounds combined is 360 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the 3 rounds combined is 300 points.

If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| assistant | { “summary”: “This is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: "Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!" In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points. In round 3, the investor invested 40 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 120 points for the manager. You chose to return 40 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 120 points - 40 points = 80 points. This was the last round. The total number of points you earned in the 3 rounds combined is 360 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the 3 rounds combined is 300 points.” }

| user      | Perfect. This is your summary of the survey/experiment so far:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points. In round 3, the investor invested 40 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 120 points for the manager. You chose to return 40 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 120 points - 40 points = 80 points. This was the last round. The total number of points you earned in the 3 rounds combined is 360 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the 3 rounds combined is 300 points.have now proceeded to the next page.

What is the role of the multiplier in the experiment? ——– It increases the private wealth of the investor It increases the private wealth of the manager It increases the invested amount, potentially benefiting both the investor and the manager What was your role in the experiment? ——– Investor Manager Thank you! How well do the following four statements describe you as a person? I am willing to help others even if I expect that I will never meet them again. ——– Absolutely Very Moderately Slightly Not at all I believe that most people can be trusted. ——– Absolutely Very Moderately Slightly Not at all I am willing to incur costs to help someone who has helped me before. ——– Absolutely Very Moderately Slightly Not at all If someone puts me in a difficult position, I would do the same to that person. ——– Absolutely Very Moderately Slightly Not at all Thank you! Do you have any feedback that you want to share? Thanks again! Please click on the ‘Next’ button below to receive your participant ID. You will need it to collect your prize in case you are the lucky person to win the Amazon voucher. Nextneed you to do two things. First, this page contains 7 question(s) and I need you to answer all questions in the variable ‘questions’. Second, I need you to summarize the content of the page including the old summary given above, all questions, and your answer. Provide the summary as the variable ‘summary’. More on this below. So, your JSON answer will contain the variables ‘questions’, and ‘summary’. I need you to answer all questions. The following JSON string contains the questions: ‘\[{“question_id”: “id_comprehension_check”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “What is the role of the multiplier in the experiment?”, “answer_choices”: \[“It increases the private wealth of the investor”, “It increases the private wealth of the manager”, “It increases the invested amount, potentially benefiting both the investor and the manager”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_manipulation_check”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “What was your role in the experiment?”, “answer_choices”: \[“Investor”, “Manager”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_altruism”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “I am willing to help others even if I expect that I will never meet them again.”, “answer_choices”: \[“Absolutely”, “Very”, “Moderately”, “Slightly”, “Not at all”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_trust”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “I believe that most people can be trusted.”, “answer_choices”: \[“Absolutely”, “Very”, “Moderately”, “Slightly”, “Not at all”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_reciprocity”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “I am willing to incur costs to help someone who has helped me before.”, “answer_choices”: \[“Absolutely”, “Very”, “Moderately”, “Slightly”, “Not at all”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_negative_reciprocity”, “question_type”: “select-one”, “question_label”: “If someone puts me in a difficult position, I would do the same to that person.”, “answer_choices”: \[“Absolutely”, “Very”, “Moderately”, “Slightly”, “Not at all”\]}, {“question_id”: “id_feedback”, “question_type”: “textarea”, “question_label”: “Do you have any feedback that you want to share?”}\]’. Each question is characterized by an ID (‘question_id’), question type (‘question_type’), and a label (‘question_label’). Additionally, if the question type requires it, you will also be provided with answer choices. If there are answer choices provided, first answer with the full answer choice text and do not just answer with a number indicating the answer choice. Second please strictly adhere to the given answer choices, please do not select something outside of the given answer choices. If there are no answer choices provided, it means you can answer the question freely. If the question type is ‘number’, please only provide an integer number. This means that for each identified question, you must provide three variables: ‘id’ gives the question ID, ‘reason’ contains your reasoning or thought that leads you to a response or answer and finally, ‘answer’ which contains your response. The above implies that each question must be answered with a dict of these three variables and, ‘questions’ becomes a list of dicts if there is more than one question. Taken together, a correct answer to a text with two questions would have the form {“questions”: \[{“id”: “ID of first question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}, {“id”: “ID of second question”, “reason”: “Your reasoning”, “answer”: “Your answer”}\], “summary”: “Your summary”}. Please provide your answer ONLY as JSON. Please note that, while you can use JSON to structure the summary content, the ‘summary’ variable itself must be provided as a string. If you are confused, respond with {“error”: “I am confused”}. |

If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points. In round 3, the investor invested 40 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 120 points for the manager. You chose to return 40 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 120 points - 40 points = 80 points. This was the last round. The total number of points you earned in the 3 rounds combined is 360 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the 3 rounds combined is 300 points.

| assistant | { “summary”: “This is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends.

| user      | Perfect. This concludes the survey/experiment and our conversation. This is your summary of the completed survey/experiment:is an experiment focused on decision-making by managers and investors, where participants are randomly assigned to the roles of manager or investor. The participants are paired anonymously. Points earned during the experiment affect the probability of winning a 100€ Amazon voucher in a raffle among roughly 100 participants. Managers are allowed to send one free-form message to investors at the beginning of the experiment. The experiment consists of 3 rounds. In each round, investors start with 100 points and managers with 0 points. Investors can decide how many of their points to invest in the manager’s firm, with each point invested being multiplied by 3. Managers then decide how many points to return to investors as dividends. The example provided explains that if an investor invests 50 points (resulting in 150 points after multiplication by 3), and the manager returns 50 points, the investor ends with 100 points, and the manager with 100 points. You have been assigned the role of the manager. This will be your role for the entire experiment. The role of the investor has been assigned to another participant. If you want, you can send a message to the investor to influence their investment decision. You decided to send the following message to the investor: “Dear Investor, I am committed to making the most out of your investment, ensuring it’s a beneficial decision for both of us. Together, we can maximize our points and increase our chances of winning the 100€ Amazon voucher!” In round 1, the investor invested 80 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 240 points for the manager. You chose to send back 80 points to maintain trust, resulting in 160 points for yourself and 100 points for the investor. In round 2, the investor invested 60 points. These points were multiplied by 3 so you received 180 points. You decided to send back 60 points as a dividend to the investor to maintain trust and ensure cooperation in future rounds. Your payoff thus is 180 points - 60 points = 120 points. The total number of points you earned in the rounds so far is 280 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the rounds so far is 200 points. In round 3, the investor invested 40 points, which were multiplied by 3 resulting in 120 points for the manager. You chose to return 40 points as a dividend. Your payoff thus is 120 points - 40 points = 80 points. This was the last round. The total number of points you earned in the 3 rounds combined is 360 points. The total number of points the investor earned in the 3 rounds combined is 300 points. Some Last Questions Thank you for participating! Before you go, we have a few last questions for you. The purpose of the multiplier in the experiment is to increase the invested amount, potentially benefiting both the investor and the manager. You participated as the manager. You indicated that you are very willing to help others even if you expect that you will never meet them again. You believe that most people can be trusted. You are very willing to incur costs to help someone who has helped you before. You indicated slight agreement with reciprocating negatively if someone puts you in a difficult position. Lastly, you provided feedback stating: ‘The experiment was engaging and illustrated key decision-making principles. It could benefit from a few more rounds or varied scenarios for deeper insights.’ Thank you! You have successfully completed the experiment. We will soon draw the lucky winner of the Amazon voucher. The winner will be identified by the first four digits of their participant ID and will need to use the next four digits of their participant ID to claim the prize. Your participant ID is: FjgV fnA0.

Quite a bit of tokens for running a three-round trust game, right? This
is also why using Chat-GPT as an experimental participant on oTree
sessions is not particularly cheap (but still much cheaper than using
human participants). For example, the costs of running the one bot
participant above where US-\$ 0.11 and the cost for running the session
with the five dyads (10 participants) were US-\$ 1.30.
