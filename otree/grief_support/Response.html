        You have a budget of {{ C.INITIAL_BUDGET }} points. You can decide how much of this budget 
        you're willing to spend on support services. Consider the service provider's introduction 
        when making your decision.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can also respond to the service provider's message or share information about 
        what kind of support you're looking for. This communication can help them provide 
        better service tailored to your needs.
