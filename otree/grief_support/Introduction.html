<p>
    This is an experiment on interaction between people seeking support and service providers.
    You have been randomly and anonymously paired with another participant.
    The roles are randomly assigned: one person will be someone who recently lost a beloved one 
    (grief-stricken person), and the other will be a service provider who helps people in grief.
    You will learn your role prior to making any decisions.
</p>
<p>
    During the experiment, you and the other participant can earn points based on your interactions.
    The amount of points that you earned will determine your final payment or the likelihood that 
    you will win a prize that will be raffled out among participants in this experiment.
</p>
<p>
    The interaction proceeds as follows:
    <ol>
        <li>The service provider can send an initial message to introduce their services</li>
        <li>The grief-stricken person can respond and decide how much they are willing to pay for support</li>
        <li>The service provider then decides how much effort to put in and what quality of service to provide</li>
        <li>Both participants can exchange additional messages throughout the process</li>
    </ol>
</p>

    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }}
        This experiment lasts {{ C.NUM_ROUNDS }} rounds.
    {{ endif }}
    {{ if C.NUM_ROUNDS > 1 }} 
        Each round, the grief-stricken person
    {{ else }} 
        The grief-stricken person
    {{ endif }}
    starts with a budget of {{ C.INITIAL_BUDGET }} points.
    They can choose to pay some or all of this budget for support services.
    The service provider starts with 0 points but can earn money by providing services,
    though providing high-quality service requires effort which has a cost.
</p>
<p>
    The effectiveness of the support is multiplied by {{ C.EFFORT_MULTIPLIER }} when provided professionally.
    However, the service provider incurs costs based on the effort they put in.
</p>
<p>
    <b>Example</b>:
    Suppose the grief-stricken person pays 60 points for services. 
    If the service provider provides effort level 5 and service quality 7,
    the total support received is (5 + 7) × {{ C.EFFORT_MULTIPLIER }} = 24 points.
    The grief-stricken person's final well-being is {{ C.INITIAL_BUDGET }} - 60 + 24 = 64 points.
    The service provider's payoff is 60 - (5 × 5) = 35 points (since each effort point costs 5).
