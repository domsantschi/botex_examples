        The grief-stricken person has decided to pay <strong>{{ payment_amount }}</strong> points for your services.
    </p>
    
    {{ if response_message }}
        <div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 15px; margin: 10px 0; background-color: #f0f8ff;">
            <h4>Message from the grief-stricken person:</h4>
            <p><em>{{ response_message }}</em></p>
        </div>
    {{ endif }}
    
    <p>
        Now you need to decide:
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Effort Level (0-10)</strong>: How much effort will you put into helping? 
                Higher effort costs you 5 points per level but may lead to better outcomes.</li>
            <li><strong>Service Quality (0-10)</strong>: What quality of service will you provide? 
                This represents the actual value you deliver to the person seeking help.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Remember: Your payoff will be the payment you receive minus the cost of your effort (effort level Ã— 5).
        The person seeking help will benefit from the combined effect of your effort and service quality,
        multiplied by {{ C.EFFORT_MULTIPLIER }}.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        You can also send a final message to the person you're helping, perhaps explaining your approach
        or offering additional support.
